- 60 card singleton
- Standard cards legal (All standard cards, if is standard anywhere then it's legal barring being ban from the format) [ex. Global Series cards are legal]

- One Free muligan
  ** A scry 1 after doing muligan after free one.
- 1v1: 25 Life
- Multi: 30 Life

- No brawler
   Too much restriction, the standard format restriction is enough.

- Current Banlist
  	*Baral
	*Sourcer's Spyglass
	 Smuggler's Copter

	*Most likely will remove, to see the impact since it seem like Baral was more tied to being the brawler and Spyglass to shutting down the brawler, since there is no brawler this may midigate the problems with these cards to being okay for the format

 Since no identity restriction, any mana
